# sql_challenge
This was my first SQL challenge (MODULE 9 CHALLENGE), and I found it easier compared to other Python Challenges. 
The background of the challenge:
I've just joined Pewlett Hackard as a data engineer. My initial task involves researching employees from the 1980s and 1990s. I have six CSV files as the only remnants of that era's employee database. My responsibilities include creating tables for the CSV data, importing it into a SQL database, and finally, conducting data analysis. This entails data modeling, engineering, and analysis.

I successfully fulfilled all of my responsibilities. 
I encountered an issue while uploading the employee CSV file due to a mismatch in the data type of the "Birth_Date" column, which was originally set as DATE. To resolve this, I adjusted it to VARCHAR. Additionally, there were concerns about the length of values across my tables, and any attempts to reduce this length resulted in import errors for the CSV files. BCS support provided assistance to facilitate the CSV upload process.

I referenced YouTube videos to assist in constructing the ERD diagram and later reached out to BCS for guidance.
Despite these challenges, I successfully finished the task, ensuring I fulfilled all my responsibilities for the challenge.
